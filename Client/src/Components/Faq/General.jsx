         title={"How can I build equity into my house?"} 
         content={"You can build equity in three ways. First (and easiest) is from market appreciation. Second, when making your monthly mortgage payment, try to send a little bit more. This will go directly to the principal of the loan, rather than the interest. Be sure your lender knows to put the extra toward principal, and not the next monthâ€™s payment. Even an extra $50 per month can quickly build equity, as well as knock years off of your loan. The third way to build equity into your house is to make improvements. There are a variety of ways to remodel and make positive changes to the interior and exterior of your home. One of the best ways is to add square footage/living space."}/>
